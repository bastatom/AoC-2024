## Usage:

```shell
go run . DAY_VARIANT
```
Where `DAY` is the number of the day to solve (e.g. `12`) and `VARIANT` is the specification of the subtask for that specific day (`a`/`b`).
Running for example `go run . 1_b` will solve the 2nd task of the 1st day and `go run . 12_a` will solve the 1st task of the 12th day.
